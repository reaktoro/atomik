/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// Substance water1("H2O");
/// Substance water2("H2O").name("WATER");
/// Substance water3("H2O").name("WATER").uid("H2O(aq)");
/// Substance water4("H2O").name("WATER").uid("H2O(g)");
/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// Substance `water1` is initialized with its name and unique identifier (uid) equal
/// to its formula, `H2O`. Substance `water2` also has its uid set to `H2O` by default,
/// but its name is modified to `WATER`. For substances `water3` and `water4`, both their
/// names and uid have been specified. In this case, the uid is used to distinguish these
/// two water substances, with same formula and name, based on their aggregate states,
/// with suffix (aq) denoting an aqueous state, and suffix (g) a gaseous state.
///
/// By default, the chemical elements of the previous four water substances were obtained
/// from an internal Elements object with default state. This database object is
/// initialized with all existing chemical elements in the periodic table. The example below
/// shows how to use a customized database of elements when constructing substances. It assumes
/// two elements `Aa` and `Bb` have been defined an appended to the database of elements.
/// The substance has chemical formula `AaBb2`.
/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// Elements elements;
/// elements.append({"Aa"});
/// elements.append({"Bb"});
///
/// Substance substance("AaBb2", elements);
///
/// std::cout << substance.coefficient("Aa") == 1 << std::endl;
/// std::cout << substance.coefficient("Bb") == 2 << std::endl;
